There ain't no such thing as a free lunch ^[1]^, or a free operating system. Somewhere, someone is paying for it. The way you're paying for that Free(tm) upgrade to Windows 10, is with your time.

Windows 10 is the result of a lot of time spent by engineers, designers, managers, technical support, accountants, maintenance people, investors, board members and a whole host of other people. As a reward for this investment of time, they aim to make money. If they can't, you won't be running Windows 10 on your device. And if you're not charged at the point of sale for the operating system, the money is made some other way. Besides being an operating system, Windows is also a platform for ads and apps. The operating system is the service, and your time spent consuming ads or buying apps is the price.

## Money is a Denomination of Time

Since you can freely spend your time on money on things you find valuable, the presence or absence of ads is entirely up to you.

If people decide to fund a different project with either their time or money, that's time not spent using Windows. And with more and more services moving to the web, the need to run native applications in Windows is decreasing. For the ones still left, there are decent alternatives. Valve is working to improve [gaming](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=&sort_by=_ASC&os=linux&page=1) on Linux, for writing, spreadsheets and presentations there is [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), for Photoshop there is [Pinta](http://pinta-project.com/) or [Krita](https://krita.org/), for Illustrator there's [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), and so on. The quality of these alternatives has a lot to do with people's willingness to fund them.

If you don't spend your time by watching ads, you can spend it by donating to an alternative project that has a different way to pay for its development. [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) is an online service that allows you to watch your television shows and movies in high quality on your media devices. It's a very succesful example of a subscription funding model, consuming well over a third of United Stated downstream internet bandwidth ^[2]^. Your monthly fees pay for its development, maintenance and expansion and in return, your entertainment is not interrupted by ads. [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/) is a free operating system free for anyone to download and install, and its success is a function of the generosity of the developers and the people donating to them. We all subsidize the things we like with our time. This is why [Western Union](https://www.westernunion.com/) is losing ground to [bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). The digital to the printed word. It's why Kodak lost the battle for photography to Nokia, and why Nokia lost the battle for cellphones to Samsung. We reward their creation with the fruits of our labor. We vote with our time.

So, I pay for the things that make my life better. I reward them with my time denominated in money, pull requests or in other ways. For the rest, there are ear buds, off buttons, ad blockers and Linux.




So, pay for the things that make your life better. Reward the things that add value to your life with your time. And don't waste it on the things that don't.

## Save Time For Things That Matter






Everyone wants a minute of your time. It's a limited resource, so spend it wisely. You only have so much of it. And that goes for the people that spend their time making products as well. Reward the things that add value to your life with your time. And don't waste it on the things that don't.


- Netflix consumes a third of all internet bandwidth

{% blockquote James Gleick %}
When information is cheap, attention becomes expensive.
{% endblockquote %}


If people valued having no ads higher than the costs of learning and funding a different operating system like Linux Mint, 


It's not

 Everyone has bills to pay, and they are paid in time spent working. The currencies that you use to pay these bills are just the denomination of time.

You want a good user experience on your device and you've got a price tag in mind to go with it. Vendors of devices keep prices low to compete, but still offer a user experience that people want.

Microsoft, like Google, makes money by advertising. The more relevant the ad is to you specifically, the more likely it is to turn into a sale, the higher the value to the advertiser. 

software development and research costs money, 


people aren't willing to fork out a lot of money for an operating system, vendors of devices want to keep prices low but not at the cost of user experience, enter stage right; advertising. Google's services aren't free, you pay for them with your information, delivered to advertisers. This only makes sense.

## But Privacy!

So it's a choice you're making. User experience for time. Time spent consuming advertising, like on television.

Time is the real currency. Our lives our finite. When we work, we're converting time into currency, used to buy things. Things that save us time. Like Roombas. Or Windows 10. But the lower price of the operating system (right now, Windows 10 is free), you will pay with your time. Time spent consuming ads. Buying products, which you pay for with time spent working.

Don't want to spend your time watching ads? Instead of ad based television, there's Netflix. Instead of Windows 10, there's Linux. But isn't Linux Free(tm)?

## Linux isn't Free Either

You can download it for free, and there are a [myriad of versions](http://distrowatch.com/) to choose from. But software development takes time. So if you like a project, give value for value. Donate some time, either converted into currency or by contributing code. The projects that succeed are the ones that people put time into.
